# dovetail
an indulgent ideas board app

---

there's a lot of text-focused apps out there, and a decent amount of boards, but nothing that really approximates the feeling of working at a desk or in a physical notebook! and that's what this is aiming to be.

ROADMAP (approximately):
- [->] basic functions
  - TODO bugfixes
    - draggable elements are leaving the HTML canvas. IF this is fine then the drag view needs to move every element instead of offsetting the body. determine which is better.
    - newline placement for text notes has related problems, if the html can expand it should be fixed.
  - [95%] create menu
  - [x] text notes
    - [] fix resizing issues for a full text note
  - [->] audio notes
  - [90%] silent image notes (png, gif, etc) (fixing titlecard and thin imgs)
  - [50%, missing codecs] video notes
    - [?] web embed notes
  - [] visual connections
  - [] deletion and arranging
  - [] board navigation
  - [->] saving, loading
  - [] board management menus
- [] customization
  - [] default customization options
  - [] user color schemes, font settings
  - [] local profile switching
  - [] hotkey customization
- [?] backend
  - [] ideally some way for remote access and handling multi-remote-user input for collaboration
